# Arcanum

Collection of experiments in the arcane snekromancy.

Python ideas and scripts

## Directories:

### Regeneration
Experiment in using a regeneration system in a game with a fun full heal (Cheese) and fishing mini game (as a joke).

### Watcher
Experiment in watching files and using data from log files. Log monitor. 

Concept is to use a log monitor of EverQuest in Linux so I can have audio cues for things like "charm break."

Similar to GINA or EQ Nag, but those work on Windows, so this is a cross platform solution.
